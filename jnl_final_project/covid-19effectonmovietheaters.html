    <p>Bart Pierce, the Executive Director at Capitol Theatre in Rome, New York, used to see the theater flooded with familiar faces coming to see what was new on the screen. He has held this position for eight years now, but nothing could have prepared him for what would happen to movie theaters once Covid-19 started to spread in the U.S.</p>

    <p>When the Covid-19 pandemic hit the U.S. in March of 2020, the movie theater business was one that got hit harder than many others. Theaters that used to be a hub for date nights or children’s birthday parties soon became completely empty, some even shutting down for good. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/29/box-office-2020-sales-plummeted-80percent-the-lowest-haul-in-decades.html">Ticket sales in 2020 fell 80 percent </a>and although the numbers began to rise again in 2021, it is a very slow incline. </p>

    <p> “Our sales were not particularly good until July 17th of last year and then we started to see an uptick. Our main theater will usually sell out, but our other screenings rarely sell out anymore,” Pierce said. </p>

    <p> Covid-19 had a direct impact on movie theater sales as seen in the charts below. Just as movie theater sales reached an all-time low in 2020, Covid-19 cases began to reach an all-time high. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-10/closed-movie-theaters-leave-void-from-small-towns-to-big-cities ">Over 600 movie theaters</a> across the country continue to remain closed over two years after the pandemic initially hit. Pierce said he feels lucky that his theater was able to sustain the troubles brought by the pandemic and continue to entertain the customers that have returned to theaters. </p>
        
<p> Capitol Theatre makes a conscious effort to keep its customers safe now that they have returned to theaters, doing an in-depth cleaning of the theaters in between each show. Many customers still choose to wear masks even though the mandate has ended. Pierce said he sees a range of comfortability from those who have chosen to return to the theater, some still wanting to social distance and others not. </p>

<div class="row">

  <p>Even with this effort though, many movie theaters, including Capitol Theatre, have struggled to bring back customers after the pandemic because of the target audience that theaters have always attracted. In a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2022/02/17/hornaday-cinema-risk-covid/"> study</a> done by the Motion Picture Association, movie-goers over 40 accounted for over 40 percent of the people who habitually attended theaters, this age range is also the most affected by Covid-19 as shown in the graph. <a href="https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2020/coronavirus-deaths-older-adults.html"> 95 percent </a> of Americans who died from Covid-19 were in the age group of 50 and older. This extremely affected age group is the same age group that made up a majority of movie theater customers which is why even as theaters reopen, sales are not growing as much as people expected. People of this age range who used to flock to theaters are now scared of what will happen to their health if they do choose to return. 
 </p>

  <p>According to Pierce, these statistics match the demographic at Capitol Theatre as many of his favorite regulars in this age group have not returned to the theater since it has reopened.
</p>

  <p>“The theater's average age of customers was 50 before the pandemic hit. After the pandemic hit we saw new and younger people, and our older, faithful patrons have not all returned yet” Pierce said. </p>

  <p> In order to combat this challenge, Capitol Theatre has made efforts to cater to younger audiences who feel comfortable coming to the theater.</p>


  <p>“We did a week of cartoons over the schools' February break that has been the best sales we have seen in a long time because young people want to get their kids out of the house after being stuck inside for so long,” Pierce said. </p>

<p>With the older generation choosing to stay in for their health, it is important for theaters to come up with new and creative ways to draw in a younger audience since so many stick to the streaming services. Streaming services like Netflix and Hulu gained massive success during the pandemic, especially because they now produce their own original content. The number of streaming service subscriptions got to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/worldwide-streaming-subscriptions-pass-one-billion-during-pandemic-11616079600"> 1.1 billion </a> worldwide in 2020. Now many are used to watching new films from the comfort of their home. 
 
</p>

<p>Pierce recognizes that streaming services have definitely become more popular in recent years, especially because of the pandemic, but argues that they can not beat the experience that comes with a movie theater. </p>

<p>“At the theater you come in and are greeted by staff who want you to have a good time. You get the movie theater popcorn and watch films with your friends and family on the big screen it’s just not the same as watching a movie from your couch,” Pierce said. </p>

<p> Although movie theater sales remain light years below what they used to be, with Capitol Theatre's new incentives to attract younger audiences to the theater, Pierce is hopeful that the business will soon boom again. </p>
